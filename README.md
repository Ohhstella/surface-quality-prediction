# surface-roughness-prediction via vibration data
IoT based surface quality prediction, a project to collect and analyze vibration data in python and use the data to predict for surface quality prediction.
# Abstract
#### When inspecting the quality of machined parts, surface roughness is an essential quality indicator. But due to the limitations of the equipment and economic reasons, it is difficult to measure the surface roughness directly during the machining process by measurement equipment. To monitor the surface quality during the milling process, this project proposed a surface quality prediction model conducted by analyzing a large amount of data from sensors and applying artificial intelligence algorithms (multiple linear regression, tree-based model (LightGBM), artificial neural network. 
#### In this project, experiments under various cutting parameters during the robot-assisted milling process are employed. The statistical data analysis of the result of these machining tests can explore the effect of cutting parameters on surface roughness. Following that, machining process optimization with better surface quality and less vibration can be obtained using prediction models developed using various approaches such as statistical regression and artificial intelligence-based models. The machine learning method and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) method are applied to extract inconspicuous features from raw vibrational signals during the data processing phase. To optimize the predictive model, the surface roughness prediction models with the combination of different parameters (depth of cut, spindle speed, feed rate, the vibration of the clamp and robot) are built. The experimental equipment used in this research is the KUKA 6-axis milling robot in Incremental Manufacturing Lab, which has more flexibility and more degrees of freedom.
